Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service. It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications. Micro Service is an architecture that allows the developers to develop and deploy services independently. Each service running has its own process and this achieves the lightweight model to support business applications.

## Hello World
SpringBoot生成非常简单, 直接新建一个Spring Initializr project并配置. 比如我们建一个名叫helloworld的项目, 就会生成`HelloworldApplication`的类, 这个类下就包含了启动项目的方法. 在同一个包下, 就可以新建其他包controller等等.
