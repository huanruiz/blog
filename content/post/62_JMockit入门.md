JMockit is an automated testing toolkit for Java. The toolkit is provided as a set of artifacts deployed to the Maven Central repository. It requires Java 7 or newer for test execution; tests must use JUnit or TestNG. For instructions on how to add the library to a Java project, see Running tests with JMockit.
