Hi, I am Harry, a new programmer but not young. This blog contains my opinions/notes about computer science. I almost know nothing about R&D before I build this blog, but I believe the power of compound interest. Keep thinking and coding.

Let's see, who will I become after 10 years.

> 学习笔记分类下的都是看的课和书的一些总结, 基本就是把原书/抄了一遍, 仅对自己查漏补缺用. 其他分类的blog更多的是我的思考和总结.
